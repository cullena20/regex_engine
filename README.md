# Regex Engine
A simple regex engine made in pure Python. Made along Jetbrains Academy. Write an input in the form {regex}|{string to check} and the script will return
True or False. This works with the '.', '^', '$', '?', '*', and '+' metacharacters. Escape sequences using '\\' are also supported.
